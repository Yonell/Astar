# Astar
Filip Piskorski 22.03.03
My first implementation of A* algorithm.
The algorithm reads the number of nodes and the edge from a file named "Graph.txt". The coordinates of points are read from a file named "coordinates.txt". In the repository I'll add an example of a graph, and points' coordinates. The coordinates are used to calculate distance between two points. The map of nodes in a real world is here: https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1WTpg8NLdqpuDjeij9L2UYt1yuwO16Loz&ll=50.06769464190169%2C19.9123083&z=15
